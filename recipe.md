**Preparation for Chilli Paneer Recipe**
1. Add 3 tablespoon corn flour, 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour 
   (maida, optional), 1/8 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon red chilli powder
   and 1/8 teaspoon pepper powder to a mixxing bowl.
  
2. Pour 5 to 6 tablespoons water and make a batter that is neither
   too thick nor too thin. if the batter is too runny, it will not coat
   the paneer. Add more water only if needed. 

3. Add 200 grams cubed paneer to the batter. Then coat then well with batter.

   **Alternative way**: if you like, you can also marinate paneer with 1/2 tbps
   chilli sauce, 1/4 tbps soya sauce and just add some dry flour to the paneer.
   It can be grilled, tawa fried, shallow fried or deep fried.

     ## **Frying paneer**

4. Heat a pan with 3 to 4 tablespoons oil. Check if the oil is hot enough
   by adding a small portion of batter to the hot oil. It must rise up
   without browning. This is the correct heat.

5. Gently slide the paneer one by one spacing them apart in the oil.
   This prevents them from sticking to each other. Fry them on a medium
   high flame. Important: Spread them in the pan while frying else they stick 
   to each other.Stir well and fry evenly until golden. You may not get the golden 
   color if you have not used chilli sauce or chilli powder.

6. Drain them on a kitchen tissue or colander.

    ## **How to make Chilli Paneer**

7. Heat 1 tbps oil in the pan. Or remove the excess oil from the pan and retain 1 tablespoon 
   in it. Add 1 tablespoon garlic and saute until they smell good.

8. Switch the flame to high. Add cubed onions greens, calsicum, sliced and deseeded chilli.
   Saute on a high flame till they are slightly cooked but still crunchy.
   while the veggies fry, go ahead to the next step.

9. **For the Restaurant style dry paneer with glossy look** - Add 1 tsp of corn flour with
   half cup water to a bowl. Stir well and set aside.

   for a healthier version, you can even skip using corn flour like it is 
   written. The smooth feel of sauce and the glaze will be missing.

10. Once the veggies are fried for a minute, pour 1 tablespoon soya sauce, 
    1/2 to 1 teaspoon vinegar, 1 to 2 tablespoons red chilli sauce or green chilli sauce,
    2 tbps tomato ketchup and 1/2 teaspoon chilli powder (optional) or paste. 

11. Stir the corn flour mixture we made earlier with a spoon and pour it to the pan.
    If you are trying to reduce corn starch in your foods then add 3 tbps water here instead 
    of corn flour slurry. 

    Red chilli sauce has some starch in it. So that will be enough to coat the paneer.
    
    **Then allow the sauce to bubble and thicken as well**. Taste the sauce and add more salt 
    & sauces if needed. Turn off the stove and let the sauce cool down a bit.

12. Next add 1/4 teaspoon pepper powder, fried paneer, 2 tablespoons spring onion greens. 
    If you have not used any corn slurry for the sauce then toss on a high flame for 1 to 2 
    minutes to bring a smoky aroma.

    Garnish chilli paneer with spring onions.

13. In a bowl, mix together 4 tablespoons chilli sauce, 2 tablespoons soya sauce, 3 tablespoons
    ketchup. Mix together 2 tablespoons cornstarch with 1 cup water to make a slurry. 
    Stir well to break any lumps.

14. After sauteening the bell peppers and onions for 2 minutes, pour sauces. 
    Turn the flame to low, and then stir the corn slurry in the bowl with a spoon.
    Pour it slowly to the pan and give a good mix. 

15. When the mixture comes to a boil and thicknes, taste test it and add half teaspoon 
    black pepper. Add more sauces or salt as desire. If the mixture turns too thick, then pour some hot
    water and stir. When the sauce is ready turn off the heat.

    Cool down a bit and then add the crisp fried paneer and give a good stir. 
    Garnish with spring onions and serve hot.
